âœ… Step 1: Install Node.js & npm
Visit: https://nodejs.org

Download the LTS version (recommended for most users).

Run the installer:

Accept defaults âœ…

Let it install both Node.js and npm

Once installed, open PowerShell and type:

ps
Copy
Edit
node -v
npm -v
You should see versions like:

Copy
Edit
v20.10.0
10.5.0
âœ… Step 2: Set Up and Run the Project
Open PowerShell

Navigate to your extracted Fermata folder:

ps
Copy
Edit
cd "C:\path\to\fermata"
Run the following to set up React:

ps
Copy
Edit
npx create-react-app . --template cra-template
Once setup completes, overwrite the default App.js with the one from the extracted ZIP (src\App.js).

Start the app:

ps
Copy
Edit
npm start
Your browser should open at:
